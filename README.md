***Resume Tips***

**Small things matter.**

Make sure your resume includes your name, mailing address, phone numbers, and email address -- all possible ways you can be contacted.

**Use active language.**

Use active language and strong, energetic words. Employers want to hear about your accomplishments, not how well you carried out your assigned duties.

**Get to the point straight.**

It’s a smart idea to quickly capture an employer’s attention begin your resume with a specific, highly condensed summary of your professional background, skills, and attributes. A summary also helps to give your resume focus.

**Proofread carefully.**

It’s important to proof your resume for typos, misspellings, and grammatical errors.

**Customize.**

If you have a broad range of experience, you may want to consider having more than one resume, each targeted to a specific industry or job.

**Be accurate & truthful.**

Make sure not to include any misleading or false information on your resume, that may eventually be discovered and lead to your losing your credibility with prospective employer.

**Express your motivation.**

It’s important to paint a clear picture of your goals and objectives, as well as the industry or position you are targeting. Make an employer to take a quick glance at your resume and have a good sense of what you want to do.

**Emphasize achievements.**

Employers are interested in previous accomplishments, like the fact that you implemented cost-cutting measures that reduced your department’s expenses by 25% is more meaningful than simply stating you oversaw a budget. Quantify your achievements in terms of percentages, amounts, or time frames to make your accomplishments more legible.

**Education to be in the right position.**

If you are a recent graduate without much work experience, put the emphasis on your education. In addition to listing the university, include information on degrees, majors & minors, grades, point average, date of completion, scholarships if any or honors received. Once you’ve got many years of work experience, education information can move to the end of the resume.

**References.**

It’s a good idea to include a list of references up front, sometimes. Make sure it’s a list of professional acquaintances that speak well of your skills and past accomplishments to prospective employers.
